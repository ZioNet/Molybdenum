1. What is Molybdenum?
  Molybdenum is an open-source rogue-like writen in Java to
  achieve the goal of being like other common rogue-like
  games only multiplayer. The game itself is set up in a way
  so that monsters, items, weapons, and worlds can be created
  by the user to create specific adventures or randomly
  generated.
  
2. Testing
  When it comes to testing the game for yourself, you have
  two options: Either clone the repo to your computer to
  play the most up to date version you can get. Or go to
  Muffinware.net and download a pre-compiled version.
